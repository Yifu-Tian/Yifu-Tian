Previously, I worked as a research assistant at [Shenzhen Institute of Artificial Intelligence and Robotics for Society](https://airs.cuhk.edu.cn/).

I was also a visiting scholar at [Univeristy of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), [Thomas M. Siebel Center for Computer Science](https://grainger.illinois.edu/about/self-guided-tour/thomas-m-siebel-center).

I am thrilled to announce that I will join [George Washington University](https://engineering.gwu.edu/) in 2026 Spring as a Ph.D. student under the supervision of Prof. Chuchu CHEN!

I am also a **UP** in Bilibili, where I regularly upload videos that discuss research papers about robotics. My goal is to record and reflect for my academic growth. Feel free to watch [here](https://space.bilibili.com/443271409?spm_id_from=333.1007.0.0).
